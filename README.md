# Smart-Kalah: A Decision Tree-based AI for Playing Kalah
This is my implementation of a mini computer AI for playing the [Kalah Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah).
This project was developed for completing the Computer Science 32 Course in UCLA.
The mini computer AI was developed using the [Decision Tree Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) under supervised training. 

This implementation is really naive, but it may demonstrate greater intelligence in playing Kalah if the depth of the decision tree is set to a higher value.
